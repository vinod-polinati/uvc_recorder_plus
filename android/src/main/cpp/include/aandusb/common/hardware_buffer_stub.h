 * This function can lock the buffer for either reading or writing.
 * It may block if the hardware needs to finish rendering, if CPU caches
 * need to be synchronized, or possibly for other implementation-
 * specific reasons.
 *
 * The passed AHardwareBuffer must have one layer, otherwise the call
 * will fail.
 *
 * If \a fence is not negative, it specifies a fence file descriptor on
 * which to wait before locking the buffer. If it's negative, the caller
 * is responsible for ensuring that writes to the buffer have completed
 * before calling this function.  Using this parameter is more efficient
 * than waiting on the fence and then calling this function.
 *
 * The \a usage parameter may only specify AHARDWAREBUFFER_USAGE_CPU_*.
 * If set, then outVirtualAddress is filled with the address of the
 * buffer in virtual memory. The flags must also be compatible with
 * usage flags specified at buffer creation: if a read flag is passed,
 * the buffer must have been created with
 * AHARDWAREBUFFER_USAGE_CPU_READ_RARELY or
 * AHARDWAREBUFFER_USAGE_CPU_READ_OFTEN. If a write flag is passed, it
 * must have been created with AHARDWAREBUFFER_USAGE_CPU_WRITE_RARELY or
 * AHARDWAREBUFFER_USAGE_CPU_WRITE_OFTEN.
 *
 * If \a rect is not NULL, the caller promises to modify only data in
 * the area specified by rect. If rect is NULL, the caller may modify
 * the contents of the entire buffer. The content of the buffer outside
 * of the specified rect is NOT modified by this call.
 *
 * It is legal for several different threads to lock a buffer for read
 * access; none of the threads are blocked.
 *
 * Locking a buffer simultaneously for write or read/write is undefined,
 * but will neither terminate the process nor block the caller.
 * AHardwareBuffer_lock may return an error or leave the buffer's
 * content in an indeterminate state.
 *
 * If the buffer has AHARDWAREBUFFER_FORMAT_BLOB, it is legal lock it
 * for reading and writing in multiple threads and/or processes
 * simultaneously, and the contents of the buffer behave like shared
 * memory.
 *
 * Available since API level 26.

 * are not a combination of AHARDWAREBUFFER_USAGE_CPU_*, or the buffer
 * has more than one layer. Error number if the lock fails for any other
